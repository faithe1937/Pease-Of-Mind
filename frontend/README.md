Reflection
This was a 3 day sprint project built during my third module at Flatiron Bootcamp. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.

One of the main challenges I ran into was Authentication. This lead me to spend quick a bit of time researching. Due to project time constraints, I feel like this project is not finished.  

I want to implement more data visualization that is unique to the user.  I want to implement Context Api and add a different language theme,tagalog, version of this app.
